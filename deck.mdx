# We as developers and designers are really good at making the impossible, possible.

<Notes>
  - I wanted to start this off with a little celebration of what we do here when we build
  things. We're bringing ideas to life, we're giving form to the formless. However you
  want to put it, we're pretty good at making the impossible, possible!
</Notes>

# Sometimes, we're so good at it, we do it unintentionally!

<Notes>
  - Sometimes, we're so good at it, we actually do it unintentionally, too! And we've got
  some really, really great user feedback commending us for these unintentional features,
  so I wanted to share a couple of them with you all.

import sutro from './images/sutro.png';

<img src={sutro} />

<Notes>
  - So just as a bit of background in case you're unfamiliar or have forgotten, the
  premise of Sutro is that you get this giant device that looks kinda like a water bottle
  to float in your pool and take readings of various chemical properties of your water.
  Interally it's powered by a replaceable cartridge, so when you first set up your Sutro
  and whenever you need to replace the cartridge, we have to recalibrate it before we can
  take readings again. We walk you through this process automatically in the app.
</Notes>

import loadingSpinner from './videos/loading-spinner.mp4';

<VideoBlock label={'*Dramatization, not actual user recording'} source={loadingSpinner} />

<Notes>
  - With that context, let me show you this amazing recording a user shared with us of one
  the unintentional features we built around calibraton. So in this recording, the user
  goes to open their app, and we tell them they need to recalibrate their Sutro Monitor.
  Amazingly, it seems we are already working on the calibration for them, as no matter
  what they do, they can't seem to interact with that "Complete Calibration" button! They
  try force-closing and reopening, and nope, still can't interact! I think that motion is
  because they're so excited! Uh, just ignore that bit at the end, I'm sure that was just
  a glitch in the video or something.

import inProgress from './videos/in-progress.mp4';

<VideoBlock label={'*Dramatization, not actual user recording'} source={inProgress} />

<Notes>
  - Here's another great one! Now usually, going through calibration requires the user to
  be present with their device in case something isn't quite right, like the lid isn't on
  tight, for example. In this interaction, the user goes to start calibration, and we
  helpfully tell them that calibration is already in progress! I guess no action required
  on their part! What a seamless experience that definitely isn't how we initially
  designed calibration to work!

# What's the problem here?

<Notes>
  - So joking aside, what's going on, here? Well, it's usually because one of several
  things happened.
</Notes>

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout verticalAlignment='top'>


# What's the problem here?

- We changed the application logic and the UI got out of sync

<Notes>
  - Maybe the application logic chaged, and the UI just got out of sync. This is probably
  how the loading spinner issue was introduced. The calibration process has evolved so
  much over time, and whatever state condition we used to rely on to tell the app we're
  "starting calibration" clearly isn't translating well to the UI anymore.
</Notes>

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout verticalAlignment='top'>


# What's the problem here?

- We changed the application logic and the UI got out of sync
- We tried to take a shortcut

<Notes>
  - This is probably what the defunct "Calibration in Progress" screen I showed you is
  about. We needed an easy way to show one screen or another depending on some state when
  calibration first starts, and the cheapest way to do so at the time was with this switch
  statement. So then we added that default case, just in case.
</Notes>

</MainLayout>

<MainLayout>


Default case is supposedly impossible to reach:

<MainLayout verticalAlignment='top'>


# What's the problem here?

- We changed the application logic and the UI got out of sync
- We tried to take a shortcut
- We forgot to reset a condition
- We missed an edge case
- We didn't handle an API response properly
- ...

<Notes>
  - But these aren't the only reasons, and I'm not here just to tell you what went wrong
  for Sutro. These problems plague every project, all the time, and it's nobody's fault
  that these bugs were reported. What I *am* here to tell you is that really, these
  reasons are just consequences of a bigger problem.
</Notes>

# We need a better model.

<Notes>
  - We've grown beyond a single "loading" boolean flag or a single switch statement with a
  default case, and there's no better demonstration of this, than...

import hwFlowDiagram from './videos/hw-flow-diagram.mp4';

<VideoBlock source={hwFlowDiagram} />

<Notes>
  - ...our HW flow diagram! I've tried to zoom out as far as I can to give you sense of
  its scale, but it also carries over to the right and overflows into various other layers
  and tabs that aren't visible. But, this is a representation of all the logic and
  communication happening behind the scenes between our app, the server, and the Sutro
  hardware itself that we have spent countless hours revising and maintaining over our
  project's lifetime. Of *course* it's been a challenge to translate this into screens on
  a phone!

# We're already used to thinking in state machines.

<Notes>
  - What I want to show you today is that you already know how a finite state machine
  works, and that's what makes it such a good choice for a modeling user interfaces. We're
  actually already used to thinking in state machines.

<TrafficLightWithControl />

<Notes>
  - A traffic light. What's going to happen when I click "next"? You all know the answer.
  *Click* And now? *Click* Okay now's the tricky one, what comes next? *Click secret
  button* HA gotcha, this traffic light got out of sync with the others and is now
  blinking red! Okay but usually you know what happens. *Click back through to red* And no
  matter how many times I iterate through this, the order will always be the same. Green,
  yellow, red. - This traffic light can be modeled as a finite state machine. Let me
  explain a bit more about what that means.
</Notes>

</MainLayout>

# First rule of Finite State Machines:

### You can only be in one state at any given time.

<Notes>
  - The first rule of finite state machines is that you can only be in one state at any
  given time.
</Notes>

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout horizontalAlignment='center'>


<Notes>
  - This makes sense, right? The light can't be both green and red at the same time.
</Notes>

<TrafficLightWithControl auto={true} />

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout>


# Second rule of Finite State Machines:

### You have a finite (as opposed to infinite) number of states.

</MainLayout>


<Notes>
  - The second rule of finite state machines is that you have to have a finite number of
  states.
</Notes>

---

<MainLayout horizontalAlignment="center">
  <Row width="70vw">
    <TrafficLight currentColor="green" />
    <TrafficLight currentColor="yellow" />
    <TrafficLight currentColor="red" />
    <TrafficLight currentColor="hazard" />
  </Row>
</MainLayout>

<Notes>
  - You can also see this really obviously with the traffic light example. Here we have 4
  well-defined states: green, yellow, red, and the hazard flashing red state, whatever you
  want to call that.
</Notes>

---

<MainLayout>


# Third rule of Finite State Machines:

### You transition from one state to another based on an event.

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout horizontalAlignment='center'>


<Notes>
  - In my contrived slideshow example, the event happens to be me pressing the "next"
  button or the secret invisible button to cut or restore the signal, but in real life
  these events would probably be timers running out, or a "signal lost" or "signal found"
  event for the flashing red state - So knowing these two rules, maybe you can start to
  imagine how this would mainfest in building a user interface.

# As a driver,

# Given, the light is red,

# When, 30 seconds have elapsed,

# Then, the light turns green.

<Notes>
  - For example, you might see how this translates to acceptance conditions. - As a
  driver, given the light is red (there's your current state), when 30 seconds has elapsed
  (there's the transition event), then, the light turns green (there's the next state).
</Notes>

import prototypes from './images/prototypes.png';

<img src={prototypes} />

<Notes>
  - In design, this translates to interactive prototypes where you have your finite number
  of screens and enumerate all of the possible transitions between them - In code, there's
  a library for building finite state machines in basically every language, but for super
  simple examples, a switch statement can usually also get the job done.
</Notes>

  </MainLayout>


---

  <MainLayout>


The problem here isn't the switch statement, it's that **the state machine is implicit**

<CodeBlock>{calibrationSwitch}</CodeBlock>

  </MainLayout>


<Notes>
  - To briefly revisit the switch statement I showed you earlier that caused the
  "Calibration in progress" bug, I want to be clear that it's not the switch statement
  itself that's bad here. It's the fact that it relies on an underlying state machine that
  is implicit. It's implementation is scattered around the code base, the transitions
  really only exist in the developers’ heads, and the states are not well-defined. This is
  what makes these bugs common and challenging to track down in any app.

import xstate from './images/xstate.png';

<img src={xstate} />

<Notes>
  - Since Sutro's app is built in javascript, I'm going to show you code examples today in
  javascript using a library called xstate. I like using it because it has pretty solid
  typescript support and its own visualizer tool...

<MachineInspector id="trafficLight" />

<CodeBlock>{trafficLightMachineCode}</CodeBlock>

<Notes>
  - ...which looks like this! Here I'm inspecting a state machine I built for the super
  basic traffic light with only three states. The current state is shown in blue, and I
  can send events to simulate the timer counting down to trigger transitions to other
  states - Here's what the machine looks like. You just plug this configuration object
  into a `Machine` function, and then you run it wherever you want. I've specified for
  this example that the initial state is 'green', and then I've defined my three states
  'green', 'yellow', and 'red'. Each state has a transition defined for the event
  'TIME_UP', which specifies which state it should move to, such as 'yellow' from 'green'.
  - Now, to add that fourth red blinking state, I could just add a "DISCONNECTED" event
  transition for all three states that takes you to the blinking state, but if we in the
  future we added 'orange' as a state of our traffic light between yellow and red, we'd
  have to remember to add that "DISCONNECTED" event transition to the new state, too, and
  I don't want to have to remember to do that, so I think I'm going to represent it a bit
  differently:
</Notes>

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout>


<MachineInspector id="expandedTrafficLight" />

<CodeBlock>{expandedTrafficLightMachineCode}</CodeBlock>

<Notes>
  - So what I've done here is actually nested state. You can see our original traffic
  light state machine is unaltered in here, and I'm calling this the "connected" state.
  But now, if the traffic light loses the signal and desyncs from the other lights at the
  intersection, it transitions to the "disconnected" state, where we'd show it flashing
  red. And once it regains the signal, it transitions back to the "connected" state and
  restarts on "green". - In the code, this looks exactly like you might expect, with our
  original traffic light states nested under the "connected" state. You can also see the
  addition of the `SIGNAL_FOUND` and `SIGNAL_LOST` events here. I've made the initial
  state "connected" now to keep parity with the example I showed you, but I imagine in
  real life when a traffic light first powers on, it might actually take a moment to sync
  up to the other lights at the intersection and thus should probably start in the
  "disconnected" state. But we're not going for realism here.

# Statechart = finite state machine with nested and/or parallel states

<Notes>
  - This machine is actually what's refered to as a statechart - it's a state machine that
  can have hierarchies of nested states as well as parallel states. This feature makes
  statecharts really effective at preventing what's known as "state explosion"...
</Notes>

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout horizontalAlignment='center'>


import stateExplosion from './images/state-explosion.svg';

<img src={stateExplosion} />

<Notes>
  - ...which happens as the total number of states and transitions you have grows. Here
  I'm showing an example state machine for a single form input field in which we show a
  different state depending on if the input is changed vs. unchanged, valid vs. invalid,
  or enabled vs. disabled. Represented as a regular finite state machine, it gets pretty
  hairy. But...
</Notes>

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout horizontalAlignment='center'>


import stateExplosionFixed from './images/state-explosion-fixed.svg';

<img src={stateExplosionFixed} />

<Notes>
  - ...as a statechart, we can repesent enabled vs. disabled as parallel states because
  all four combinations of them are real states and they can each change independendently
  of the other one. We also decide that for this form input, we only consider an input
  valid or invalid if it's been changed, so we nest that state within "changed". now we
  have fewer states and events to worry about, and we can represent the parallel states in
  our UI completely separately from one another.
</Notes>

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout>


<CodeBlock>{expandedTrafficLightMachineCode}</CodeBlock>

<Notes>
  - Back to our traffic light, it's not *really* necessary that you understand every
  distinction between finite state machines and statecharts. I just wanted to point it out
  since technically speaking, for the rest of the presentation, I'll be working with
  statecharts. And just in case you had *any* doubt...
</Notes>

</MainLayout>


---

<MainLayout>


<CodeBlock fontSize="small">{trafficLightCode}</CodeBlock>

<Notes>
  - Yes, the traffic light I was showing you earlier *IS* built with this exact
  statechart! - xstate offers a react add-on that comes with this `useMachine` hook that
  interprets the machine and returns a tuple of the current state and a function to send
  events to the machine - the state object has a `matches` function I can call to check
  what the current state is, like this - the traffic light component itself is just a
  series of boxes and circles that shows the circle of the currentColor prop you give it
  here, so I then manage this current color with local component state that changes
  whenever the machine's state changes - lastly you can see here the "next" button that,
  on press, simulates the traffic light timer being up by sending the "TIME_UP" event. I
  also have the invisible butotn that sends the "SIGNAL_FOUND" or "SIGNAL_LOST" event
  depending on the current state.
</Notes>

</MainLayout>

<MainLayout>


# Enough with the traffic lights already!

<Notes>
  - But okay, you're probably sick of me talking about this traffic light by now. No
  application is as simple as this, so you're probably wondering how well how well
  statecharts scale to something more realistic like Sutro and the calibration process. So
  for the last part of this presentation, I'll actually walk you through what the process
  was like to rebuild our calibration flow using a state machine.
</Notes>

</MainLayout>


---

<CodeSandboxLayout id={0} />

<Notes>
  - Just like with my traffic light, remember that these buttons are just the way we're
  going to artificially trigger events for our machine. In reality, a lot of these events
  are actually not triggered by the user interacting with the app, but rather something
  happening on the server based on our communication with the hardware.
